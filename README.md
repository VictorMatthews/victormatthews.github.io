## My Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website built with Angular.

You can access the website via https://victormmatthews.me

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Deployment

Run `ng deploy --no-silent` to have [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages) build and push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch. Then create a PR to merge `gh-pages` into `master`

If you get an error during the deploy you may need to increase the git http.postBuffer. This can be done with `git config --global http.postBuffer 257286400`
